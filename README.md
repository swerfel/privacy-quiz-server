# privacy-quiz-server
## Description
This is a simple online version of the privacy board game developed for small socializing events during pandemic events.

You can find the corresponding client here: https://github.com/swerfel/privacy-quiz

## Don't use it blindly
Pay attention to the Admin-Check (you are admin if your name is Sergej ;) ). That is not pretty secure, but was enough for some games in a trustworthy company.

To reduce complexitiy (and so have only one deployment for this sandbox project) the client is build and copied into the client-directory of this project. Don't do that in serious projects ;)

This project is not maintained. Please update the dependencies, if you want to start from here.
